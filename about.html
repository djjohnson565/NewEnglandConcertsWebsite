      <h2>Rock/Metal focused concert footage from around New England! Based out of Central Massachusetts/Metro West.</h2>
      <h3>Content featured here is for a few select shows that one (or more) of our organizers have attended. This is not a wiki for all concerts that have occured in the New England area for all time. We focus on giving a more in-depth review to the shows we goto, and to document as much information about the shows as possible.</h3>
